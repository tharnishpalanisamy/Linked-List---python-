Linked List in Python

This repository contains a complete implementation of the Linked List data structure in Python. It is built entirely from scratch without relying on Python’s built-in list, allowing a clearer understanding of how Linked Lists work internally. The project covers all fundamental operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, searching, updating, and reversing. It also includes implementations of both singly and specialized linked list operations where applicable.

In addition to the core data structure, the repository includes solutions to all the Linked List problems I have solved on LeetCode. These solutions demonstrate how theoretical Linked List concepts are applied to real coding interview challenges.

LeetCode Linked List Problems

The repository contains clean, well-structured Python solutions to all Linked List problems I have solved on LeetCode, such as:

Reverse Linked List

Merge Two Sorted Lists

Remove Nth Node From End of List

Linked List Cycle and Cycle Detection

Middle of the Linked List

Palindrome Linked List

Delete Node in a Linked List

Add Two Numbers

Copy List with Random Pointer

And more, updated as I solve new problems
